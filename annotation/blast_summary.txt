TAXONOMIC ASSIGNMENT
====================
S1 Table. Summary of results of taxonomic annotation.
Sequences were queried against the full NCBI nucleotide database (nt) "${blast_db}" obtained on "DATE OF DATABASE DOWNLOAD", using the BLASTN algorithm with a word size of "${word_size}"  
if [ "${identity}" = 0 ]; then
		with no restriction on the lower bound for percent identity.
	else
		and a minimum of "${identity}"\% identity.
fi
A maximum of "${num_matches}" hits were retained per query sequence; if match quality dropped after "${culling_limit}" sequences, matches were no longer retained.
We used a nested approach whereby sequences were queried at sequentially higher  e-value thresholds (i.e. inferior match) until a match was assigned. The e-value thresholds were determined based on a preliminary assessment of the best possible e-value given sequence length and database size ("${nested_evalues}"=( 4.430273e-52 3.077510e-48 2.137807e-44 1.485037e-40 1.031588e-36 7.165977e-33 4.977879e-29 3.457907e-25 2.402052e-21 1.668597e-17 1.159098e-13 10)).


Thus, we report here the lowest taxonomic classification at which there was agreement among equally good matches.
