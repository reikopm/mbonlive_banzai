VirtualBox Installation
=======================

The CentOS 7 system installed by VagrantFile includes the Guest Additions for
VirtualBox Version 4.3.22, so if you would like better integration of this
virtual machine with your host operating system you should install that 
version of VirtualBox. 

Look in the [VirtualBox older builds](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
section of the Downloads area on https://www.virtualbox.org.
